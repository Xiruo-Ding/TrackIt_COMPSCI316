# TrackIt_COMPSCI316
This is the course project for COMPSCI 316 - Intro to Database System at Duke. This is the project by a team of 4. I am responsible for building python/flask framework. All web designs and SQL queries are done by my teammates. I modified part of HTML files according to Jinja2 templates for the framework to run.

This repository only contains the front-end design, so the queries and tables will not show correctly without creating the database in the system. But the framework should work.

Python: 2.7.6

Flask: 0.12

The database is PostgreSQL.

Note that the log in system is not perfect: it does not use hash codes for storing the passwords, the authentification is not complete.
